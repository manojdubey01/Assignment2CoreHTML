     <h1>Home Page</h1>
     <p>Hello, my name is Manoj Dubey and I am writing to introduce myself. My interests include photography, art, and music. 
        I enjoy making things out of clay and woodworking. <br>

        I am a native of the India and have been in Mumbai for over 8 years now. I grew up in Rishra where I attended school. 
        After high school, I moved to Kolkata where I went to college at <br> Saroj Mohan Institute of Technology. 

        During college, it was not easy for me to make friends because I was shy and quiet. It wasnâ€™t until after college when 
        I started working at Antares <br> Systems, that my relationships with others changed for the better. At work, I was able to 
        open up more as well as learn how to communicate better with others by using body language <br> and tone of voice rather than
        words alone. This resulted in me being promoted from a part-time employee into an assistant manager position within two 
        years of working there full-time!
